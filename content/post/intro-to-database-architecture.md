# Database Architecture

Data is the fuel of any product. And managing that data is an essential part of software architecture.

### A little prelude

Recently, I thought of starting an article series, which would help anybody in product development. The broader idea aside, each week will follow a particular theme or part of product dev and we will try to cover as much as possible. Hopefully, we can continue this long enough to cover most of what we might need to develop, maintain, manage and scale our products.
As we begin our journey, letâ€™s kick off with low level design which might lead on to a greater system design concept. We will try to bring in theories and practices followed today and also try to explore a few of our own experiments. Since, this is an ongoing experience, hopefully some of you can be part of it by the end of it.

There are different types of databases and each has their own particular use-case to a certain extent. Relational, Hierarchal, Object-Oriented and Network Databases form most of the different types of databases out there.
