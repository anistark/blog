Many a times when we get stuck on something and the only way to move forward and forget and remember at the same time to write about it.
Here's goes a few of those experiences that I would love to share with you.

I love solving problems, designing backend architecture and discussing business strategy.

At the moment, building blockchain and DLT products at [Acyclic Labs](https://acycliclabs.com/), building communities at [Blockchained India](https://blockchainedindia.com/), [IEN](https://ien.io/), [BangPypers](https://www.meetup.com/bangpypers) and [DjangoGirls Bangalore](https://djangogirls.org/bangalore). Open Source enthusiasts and run several open source projects.

I love music and anime and during my travels, reading books.
