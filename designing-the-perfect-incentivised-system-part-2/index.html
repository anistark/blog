            <p>A lot of the recent rise in isekai anime also suggests a favorable wind towards perfecting our system.</p>
<p>In the anime <em>Hunter x Hunter</em>, the incentive system plays a crucial role in driving the narrative and character development, particularly in the context of the Hunter Exam and various arcs throughout the series.</p>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/papyrus_images/e86642535ce1826c72f6dfce2ebc8bc4.webp" alt=""></p>
<h1 id="the-hunter-exam" tabindex="-1"><strong>The Hunter Exam</strong></h1>
<p>The most prominent example of an incentive system in <em>Hunter x Hunter</em> is the Hunter Exam, which is designed to evaluate the potential of aspiring Hunters. This exam offers various incentives and motivations for participants, leading to a competitive environment.</p>
<h4 id="key-features%3A" tabindex="-1">Key Features:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Status and Prestige</strong>: Becoming a Hunter is a prestigious achievement that grants access to exclusive resources, knowledge, and opportunities. The allure of becoming a Hunter motivates numerous characters to enter the exam, despite its dangers.</p>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/papyrus_images/39807beb644d9f047eb27a3519dfed8a.gif" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diverse Challenges</strong>: The exam comprises multiple stages, each presenting unique challenges that test candidates’ physical and mental abilities. The variety of tasks incentivizes different skill sets and encourages teamwork and strategy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Elimination Format</strong>: The exam’s competitive nature, where candidates are eliminated based on performance, adds a layer of urgency. This structure incentivizes candidates to perform at their best to avoid being cut from the competition.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="individual-and-team-incentives" tabindex="-1"><strong>Individual and Team Incentives</strong></h3>
<p>Throughout the series, characters often face situations where individual goals conflict with group objectives, reflecting the dynamics of incentive systems.</p>
<h4 id="examples%3A" tabindex="-1">Examples:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alliances and Betrayals</strong>: Characters like Gon, Killua, and Leorio form alliances to navigate challenges. However, their individual motivations can lead to conflicts, showcasing the tension between personal and collective goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Personal Growth</strong>: The characters are often driven by personal desires—Gon’s quest to find his father, Killua’s struggle for independence from his family, and Kurapika’s desire for revenge. These individual incentives create depth in their motivations and actions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nen-and-its-role-as-an-incentive-system" tabindex="-1"><strong>Nen and Its Role as an Incentive System</strong></h3>
<p>The Nen system in <em>Hunter x Hunter</em> serves as a complex incentive structure that rewards training, strategy, and creativity in combat.</p>
<h4 id="key-features%3A-1" tabindex="-1">Key Features:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Personalization</strong>: Nen abilities are unique to each user and are based on their personality and experiences. This personalization incentivizes Hunters to invest time and effort into mastering their abilities, as they become extensions of themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategic Thinking</strong>: The Nen system encourages strategic thinking, as users must understand their strengths and weaknesses and those of their opponents. The incentive to outsmart foes adds layers to battles, making them not just about power but also about wits.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="consequences-and-trade-offs" tabindex="-1"><strong>Consequences and Trade-offs</strong></h3>
<p>The series also highlights the consequences of the incentive systems in place, particularly regarding the ethical implications of the Hunters’ choices.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Moral Dilemmas</strong>: Characters often face moral dilemmas where the pursuit of their goals can lead to negative consequences for others. For instance, some Hunters prioritize their objectives over the well-being of others, raising questions about the ethics of their actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sacrifices</strong>: The journey of becoming a Hunter often requires personal sacrifices, be it in terms of relationships, physical well-being, or moral integrity. This reflects the trade-offs inherent in any incentive system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-auction-and-the-underworld" tabindex="-1"><strong>The Auction and the Underworld</strong></h3>
<p>Another significant incentive system is the auction and underworld dealings that occur later in the series, particularly during the Greed Island and Chimera Ant arcs.</p>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/papyrus_images/4bd570283a05392dc715b1489c4c0080.webp" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="features%3A" tabindex="-1">Features:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Scarcity and Value</strong>: Rare items and information become valuable commodities in the auction system, incentivizing Hunters to participate in dangerous missions to acquire them. The allure of these items drives characters into conflict and competition. 💎</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Risk vs. Reward</strong>: The underworld emphasizes the risk involved in pursuing rewards. Characters must weigh the potential gains against the dangers they face, illustrating the high stakes associated with their desires. ⚖</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In <em>Hunter x Hunter</em>, the various incentive systems—ranging from the Hunter Exam to the Nen system and the underworld dealings—serve to shape character motivations, drive the plot, and explore deeper themes of morality, competition, and personal growth. The complexity of these systems reflects the series’ intricate storytelling, making it a rich exploration of human desires and the consequences of pursuing them.</p>

<h1 id="tower-of-god" tabindex="-1">Tower of God</h1>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/papyrus_images/4255d41e189d4a71c5019525b6fe3aff.webp" alt=""></p>
<p>In the anime <em>Tower of God</em>, we see the incentive system is intricately woven into the narrative and serves as a crucial mechanism for driving character motivations, conflicts, and the overall plot. The Tower itself functions as a multi-layered arena where characters face various challenges, each governed by its own set of incentives and rules.</p>
<h3 id="climbing-the-tower" tabindex="-1"><strong>Climbing the Tower</strong></h3>
<p>At the core of <em>Tower of God</em> is the overarching goal of climbing the Tower, which serves as the primary incentive for many characters. The Tower promises immense power, wealth, and the chance to achieve one’s dreams at the top.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Desire for Power and Fulfillment</strong>: Each character has their own motivations for climbing, ranging from personal ambition to the desire to reunite with loved ones. For example, Bam’s journey is driven by his desire to find Rachel, while other characters seek glory or revenge.</p>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/papyrus_images/34633b38f5c5ffa4f9502e2e94f3ce3f.avif" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Challenges and Trials</strong>: The Tower is divided into multiple floors, each presenting unique tests and challenges. Successfully overcoming these trials serves as an incentive for characters to prove their strength and skill.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-role-of-rankers" tabindex="-1"><strong>The Role of Rankers</strong></h3>
<p>Within the Tower, there are two main categories of climbers: regulars and rankers. Rankers are those who have already ascended and achieved a high status, serving as both mentors and adversaries to the regulars.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Authority and Status</strong>: Rankers hold significant power and influence within the Tower, and this status serves as a major incentive for regulars to aspire to reach their level. This dynamic creates a competitive atmosphere where regulars must constantly prove themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rewards and Responsibilities</strong>: Rankers often receive special privileges and responsibilities, which can incentivize them to assist or manipulate regulars in their ascent. The relationships between rankers and regulars can create complex social dynamics based on competition and cooperation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/papyrus_images/2e20731f1a03c04ebfb82b25fdb12707.webp" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="the-test-and-competition-structure" tabindex="-1"><strong>The Test and Competition Structure</strong></h3>
<p>The various tests within the Tower are structured to foster competition among regulars, which is a fundamental aspect of the incentive system.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Teamwork vs. Individualism</strong>: Many challenges require cooperation among climbers, creating a dual incentive of working together to succeed while also competing for individual glory. This dynamic is evident in the early tests, where characters must form alliances to survive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Elimination and Advancement</strong>: The competitive nature of the tests means that failure results in elimination from the Tower, which serves as a powerful motivator. The threat of elimination encourages characters to push their limits and take risks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/papyrus_images/d67baa30dfeb7fc08fc6902a379adaa6.avif" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In <em>Tower of God</em>, the incentive system is multifaceted, shaping the motivations and actions of characters as they navigate the challenges of the Tower. The interplay between personal desires, competition, and the hierarchical structure of regulars and rankers creates a rich narrative landscape. The series delves into the complexities of ambition, sacrifice, and the human experience, making the incentive system an integral part of its storytelling.</p>

<h1 id="solo-levelling" tabindex="-1">Solo Levelling</h1>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/papyrus_images/5f1adb41dd6c0f8fbb953384332a7b81.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>One of my personal favorites.</em> In the anime <em><strong>Solo Leveling</strong></em>, the ranking and incentive system is central to the story’s premise and character development. The world is divided into Hunters—individuals who possess supernatural abilities and engage in battles against monsters from dungeons. The ranking system not only categorizes Hunters but also serves as a key incentive mechanism, motivating characters to grow stronger and face increasingly formidable challenges. Here’s a detailed exploration of the ranking and incentive system in <em>Solo Leveling</em>:</p>
<h3 id="hunter-ranks" tabindex="-1"><strong>Hunter Ranks</strong></h3>
<p>The ranking system in <em>Solo Leveling</em> categorizes Hunters based on their strength and abilities. The ranks are typically divided into several tiers, from the lowest to the highest:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>E-Rank</strong>: The weakest category, often consisting of inexperienced Hunters with limited abilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>D-Rank</strong>: Slightly stronger than E-Rank, but still considered low-tier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>C-Rank</strong>: Competent Hunters capable of handling moderate threats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>B-Rank</strong>: Stronger Hunters who can take on more challenging dungeons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A-Rank</strong>: Highly skilled Hunters with significant abilities and experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>S-Rank</strong>: The elite class of Hunters, known for their exceptional strength and prowess.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/papyrus_images/5fc97165457cd818bd4bce7d0d2a3753.avif" alt=""></p>
<p>This ranking system not only establishes a hierarchy among Hunters but also influences their status, opportunities, and how they are treated in society.</p>
<h3 id="incentives-for-levelling-up" tabindex="-1"><strong>Incentives for Levelling Up</strong></h3>
<p>The ranking system provides various incentives for Hunters to level up and improve their abilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Recognition and Prestige</strong>: Higher-ranked Hunters gain social status and respect. The desire to be recognized as a strong and capable Hunter drives many characters to strive for improvement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access to Better Resources</strong>: Higher ranks often translate to access to more lucrative missions and dungeons, as well as better gear and resources. This creates a tangible incentive for Hunters to train and advance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Financial Rewards</strong>: Completing higher-level dungeons typically yields greater monetary rewards. As Hunters rise in rank, the potential for earning increases, motivating them to take on more challenging tasks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Of course in this anime only our protagonist can level up.</em></p>
<h3 id="the-role-of-dungeons" tabindex="-1"><strong>The Role of Dungeons</strong></h3>
<p>Dungeons are critical to the ranking system, as they serve as the primary battlegrounds for Hunters. The difficulty of the dungeon often corresponds to the rank of the Hunters needed to clear it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Increased Challenge</strong>: Higher-ranked dungeons require stronger Hunters, presenting a significant incentive for individuals to level up. The potential for earning greater rewards in higher-level dungeons drives Hunters to improve their skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Experience and Growth</strong>: The process of entering dungeons allows Hunters to gain valuable experience, level up, and hone their abilities. As they face stronger monsters, they have the opportunity to prove themselves and ascend in rank.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-protagonist%E2%80%99s-journey" tabindex="-1"><strong>The Protagonist’s Journey</strong></h3>
<p>The story follows Sung Jin-Woo, an E-Rank Hunter who starts at the bottom of the ranking system. After a near-fatal encounter in a double dungeon, he gains a unique ability that allows him to “level up” in a video game-like manner.</p>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/papyrus_images/1ab7a083948427e701858462b6413a0f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Unique Incentive Mechanism</strong>: Jin-Woo’s ability to level up independently of the traditional ranking system sets him apart. This mechanic serves as a powerful incentive for his growth, as he can train and gain strength rapidly compared to his peers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transformative Growth</strong>: As he levels up, Jin-Woo transitions from being one of the weakest Hunters to an S-Rank Hunter. His journey highlights the incentives tied to perseverance, dedication, and the pursuit of power.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="social-and-psychological-factors" tabindex="-1"><strong>Social and Psychological Factors</strong></h3>
<p>The ranking and incentive system also explores social dynamics and psychological motivations among Hunters.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Competition and Rivalry</strong>: The hierarchical nature of the ranking system fosters competition among Hunters. This rivalry can lead to alliances or conflicts, as individuals strive to outperform one another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fear of Weakness</strong>: Many Hunters experience anxiety about their rank, as being labeled weak can lead to social stigma and reduced opportunities. This fear drives characters to push themselves harder and take greater risks to improve their status.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="consequences-of-the-system" tabindex="-1"><strong>Consequences of the System</strong></h3>
<p>The ranking and incentive system in <em>Solo Leveling</em> also has its darker aspects, revealing the pressures and challenges that come with the pursuit of power.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Moral Dilemmas</strong>: Characters may face ethical choices when pursuing their goals, such as sacrificing others for personal gain or engaging in ruthless competition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mental Strain</strong>: The constant pressure to rank up and improve can lead to mental strain and burnout, as Hunters push themselves to their limits.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/papyrus_images/9cfdcb65ce98c49be2f8c4477dbe6665.avif" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ranking and incentive system in <em>Solo Leveling</em> serves as a vital framework for character motivations, societal dynamics, and the overarching plot. By establishing clear tiers of strength and associated rewards, the system encourages characters to grow and adapt, creating a compelling narrative of struggle and triumph. The series effectively explores themes of ambition, competition, and the costs associated with the pursuit of power, making the ranking system an integral aspect of its storytelling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar scoring systems are used in multiple real life scenarios as is in anime. The limits of a limitless system is the most crucial point for the existence of any perpetual system. If we know what’s supposed to be the peak and what’s the rock bottom, we have our range to work with. But often, in society and life, the strongest keeps changing and so does our knowledge of the weakest.</p>
