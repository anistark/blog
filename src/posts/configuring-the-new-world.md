To build the CyberSpace, we will need the few basic building blocks. It might vary based on what space you're crafting. First is layout. Of course, that would depend on the interface. If it's a web interface, layout can be website. If it's mobile interface, it can be app or VR. If it's a smart glass, it can be AR/XR and so on.  
The most easiest and accessible layouts today is web. So, we will start building our space with web interface. Now, say your website is made, through which you can access your space. It needs to run on a browser, and that browser needs to run on an OS which is supported by the device.  
Hopefully, technology will keep evolving and we'll find ourselves face to face with amazing interfaces.

Now, as a build, you need to make your website available to others to access. For this, we've so far used internet or [www](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web), where we communicate over http or https. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol in the Internet protocol suite model for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. When you visit a url link, it takes you to it's Domain Name System and maps to a cloud server located somewhere on planet earth. This is identified by IP and maps internally with however you've deployed in it. There are server engines like NGINX and APACHE, which then runs your app server, which might be in high level languages like python, js, rust, go and so on. Now this app interacts with other services that it needs to over the same https and other relevant channels. The packet delivery mostly follows TCP/IP and UDP. These servers require constant power and maintenance which is in itself a quite challenging task. Normal users will not want to take on that headache, and so it turned out to be monopolised by larger firms like Amazon, Google and Microsoft amongst others. You can pay a small fee on monthly basis and they'll happily take care of the physical servers for you.

However, this is web2 and we're looking forward to web3 already. So, we'd need to setup decentralised machines to run a decentralised network.
